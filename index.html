        <h2>Statement of Signifigance</h2>

            <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
            <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
        </ul>
                
            <p>Boyd joined the National Capital Planning Committee (<abbr title ="National Capital Planning Committee">NCPC</abbr>) in January 1968 as one of two architectural experts, the other being Professor Gordon Stephenson from Western Australia. Boyd and Stephenson were charged with creating a statement of civic design philosophy that would form the basis of the NCDC policies relating to the Buildings (Design and Siting) Ordinance 1964. These policies would guide the aesthetic, development principles and layout of buildings in the National Capital areas of Canberra.</p>
